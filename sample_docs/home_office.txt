IRS Publication 587 - Business Use of Your Home

HOME OFFICE DEDUCTION

If you use part of your home exclusively and regularly for business, you may be able to deduct expenses related to the business use of your home.

QUALIFYING FOR THE DEDUCTION

Requirements:
1. Regular and exclusive use - The space must be used regularly and exclusively for business
2. Principal place of business - Your home office must be your principal place of business, OR
3. Meeting clients - You regularly meet clients, customers, or patients at your home, OR
4. Separate structure - The space is a separate structure used for business

Exclusive Use Exceptions:
- Daycare facilities
- Storage of inventory or product samples

EMPLOYEES vs. SELF-EMPLOYED

Self-Employed: Can deduct home office expenses on Schedule C
Employees: As of 2018, employees can no longer deduct unreimbursed home office expenses (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated this deduction through 2025)

CALCULATING THE DEDUCTION

Two Methods:

1. SIMPLIFIED METHOD
- $5 per square foot of home office space
- Maximum 300 square feet
- Maximum deduction: $1,500 per year
- No depreciation deduction or recapture

2. REGULAR METHOD
Calculate actual expenses based on percentage of home used for business.

Business Percentage = Office Square Footage ÷ Total Home Square Footage

Direct Expenses (100% deductible):
- Painting or repairs to office only
- Dedicated business phone line

Indirect Expenses (deductible based on business percentage):
- Mortgage interest or rent
- Real estate taxes
- Homeowner's insurance
- Utilities (electricity, gas, water)
- Home repairs and maintenance
- Depreciation of home
- Security system
- HOA fees

DEPRECIATION

Using the regular method, you can depreciate the business portion of your home over 39 years (nonresidential property).

Important: When you sell your home, you may need to recapture depreciation taken (taxed at 25% rate).

DEDUCTION LIMITS

The home office deduction cannot exceed your gross income from the business use of your home, minus:
- Business expenses not related to home use
- Mortgage interest and real estate taxes (deductible regardless of business use)

Excess deduction can be carried forward to future years.

DAYCARE FACILITY EXCEPTION

If you use part of your home regularly (but not exclusively) for daycare, you can calculate the deduction based on:
- Percentage of home used for daycare
- Percentage of time used for daycare

Example:
- 40% of home used for daycare
- Daycare operates 12 hours/day, 250 days/year
- Time percentage: (12 × 250) ÷ 8,760 = 34.2%
- Business percentage: 40% × 34.2% = 13.7%

RECORDS TO KEEP

Maintain documentation including:
- Floor plan showing office area
- Total square footage of home
- Receipts for home expenses
- Time log (if daycare)
- Evidence of business use

FORM 8829

Use Form 8829 to calculate the home office deduction when using the regular method. Report the deduction on Schedule C, Line 30.

IMPACT ON HOME SALE EXCLUSION

If you use the simplified method or don't claim depreciation, the full $250,000/$500,000 home sale exclusion generally remains available.

If you claimed depreciation, you must recapture it as ordinary income (up to 25% tax rate) when selling the home, but the remaining gain may still qualify for the exclusion.
